You will need java 8 or above to run the application.

NetBeans:
If you want to open the source code in NetBeans IDE you can just open the project in the IDE
(You may also need to import the "jlfgr-1_0.jar" library)

Other IDEs:

1. Create a new project.
2. Copy all the files from the "MySchedule_NetBeans_IDE/src" into the source folder of your project
3. import the "jlfgr-1_0.jar" library to your project libraries.
(A suggestion, first copy "jlfgr-1_0.jar" into your project folder, and from there add it to your project libraries)
(Depending on your IDE, you may also need to import the javafx library too.)
